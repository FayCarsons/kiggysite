# Kiggysite [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/62a988dc-713e-4e92-9f92-f9b943b97122/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/kristenrankin/deploys)

A portfolio website made in collaboration with visual developer [Kristen Rankin](https://www.instagram.com/k1ggy). It can be viewed [here](https://www.kristenrankin.art) <br>

The project is built with Vite and uses Solid JS for reactivity. <br>
It can be run with `npm run dev`, or `npm run build && npm run preview` for an optimized version. <br>
The site is image-heavy, requiring the development of image-optimization tools including [Imageopt-rs](https://github.com/FayCarsons/Imageopt-rs), a Rust CLI tool for batch converting, resizing, and serializing the metadata of images.
